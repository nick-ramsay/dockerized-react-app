# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This React application has been created and prepared for Docker with the steps below:

## Step 1: Set Up the React App
First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, create a new React app using Create React App.

### 1. Create the React App:
```
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
```

### 2. Test the App:

```
npm start
```

Ensure the app runs locally by visiting http://localhost:3000.

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
Next, create a Dockerfile in the root of your React app directory.

### 1. Create Dockerfile:

```
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Install a simple HTTP server to serve static content
RUN npm install -g serve

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the app
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build"]
```

## Step 3: Build and Run the Docker Container
### 1. Build the Docker Image:

```
docker build -t my-react-app .
```
### 2. Run the Docker Container:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app
```

## Step 4: Test the Containerized App
Once the container is running, you can access the React app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Summary
Youâ€™ve successfully created a simple React app, containerized it using Docker, and run it in a Docker container. This setup ensures that your React app can run consistently across different environments.
